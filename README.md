# Local ChatGPT-like Application

This project is a simple implementation of a ChatGPT-like application that runs locally on your machine. It is designed to simulate a conversational AI, allowing users to interact with the bot through a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- Local execution of a conversational AI model.
- Simple and intuitive user interface.
- Persistent conversation history using a local database.

## Installation

Before you can run the application, make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download and install Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

Once Node.js is installed, clone the repository to your local machine and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://your-repository-url.git
cd your-project-directory
npm install
```

## Usage

To start the application, run the following command in the root directory of the project:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the local server and the chatbot interface will be available in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
